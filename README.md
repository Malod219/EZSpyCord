# EZSpyCord
An open source tool designed for discord. You can do a lot with it. I am not intending for it to be used for malicous purposes, but rather to demonstrate clearly the flaws in what is possible with the discord api.
# How to install
1 - Download the .py files.
2 - Make sure you have python 3.6 installed
3 - Install the modules used(Missing modules will be displayed every time you run. Will make a requirements file to remove this step later)
4 - Run EZSpyCordMenu.py

I will streamline this later with a .bat and a .sh script to be run to simplify installation.
# Want to help develop this?
Make a push/pull request, and add whatever new functionality you want to add. If you add new choices, please keep them exclusive to your own python module(See info functions/Social functions for an example of this). Payload Functions is still quite underdeveloped.
# ToDoList
- Joining servers from a txt file containing server join links
- Running with a txt file containing tokens and bot/not state to be run as a sort-of-botnet
- Add some chatlog scraping functionality

Whoever you are reading this, I hope you take advantage of this only for its data mining functionalities. The other more malicous functions are only there as a proof of concept of what bad things could be done with the Discord Api. The most significant thing that need to be done by the Discord Api in my opinion is for the discord team to figure out some way to completely block/stop the use of selfbots. Personally my favourite part is the emoji ripping functionality.

# Notes
servers.txt is included to demonstrate how to order your server ids for any large selections of servers
